# mopac_scikit

A repository demonstrating how machine learning can be applied to Mopac, a central Texas highway.  In 2018, a toll road was built that determines prices at multiple checkpoints based on the level of traffic at each time of day.  As one would expect, rush hour (7-9am and 4-6pm) would be the most congested and therefore have the highest prices.  This assumption was tested using scikit-learn and the model shows high accuracy in predicting the toll prices.
